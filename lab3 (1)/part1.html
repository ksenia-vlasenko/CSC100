We use computers today to communicate with our friends,      listen to music, share images with our family, shop online, play games,      watch movies, analyze and visualize large amount of data, design      automobiles and aircrafts, maintain medical records, automate industrial      process, search hugh volume of information, identify our location in a      map, etc. In the coming decade, we could use computers to analyze our      genetics and synthesize new drugs, to assist doctors to identify unknown      diseases, to assist us intelligently driving our cars. The potential for      computer applications in the near future is limited only by our      imagination. Our next generation should learn how to use computers more      effectively as a tool than merely using it for entertainment.     </p>    <hr>    <h1>Faculty of Engineering</h1>    <img src="images/engr.jpg" alt="Engineering">    <p>      UVic Engineering graduates help invent the future.
