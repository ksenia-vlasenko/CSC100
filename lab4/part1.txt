We are going to create a slideshow of your favourite artist. There is only a single file
slides.html, which includes the <style></style> stylesheet and <script></script> JavaScripts.



Step 1
------
Study "slides.html" carefully. It includes the following stylesheet <style></style> and JavaScript <script></script> when this page is loaded.

There is only 1 <h1> heading and 1 <img> tag inside this page, followed by 2 <button>s.
Currently, the two buttons don't do anything if you click them.

Inside our lab4 folder, there are 3 images, each of which is 600 by 600 pixels.



Step 2
------
Currently, there are 3 images used in this slideshow. In order to start the slideshow, you need to call the functioin "play()"; to stop it, you need to call the function "stop()".


First, you need to add the attribute onclick to each button

 <button class="round" onclick="play()">Play</button>

and 

 <button class="round" onclick="stop()">Stop</button>

Then, you need to add id="myimage" to the <img>.

<img id="myimage" src="shania.jpg">

So that, the JavaScript can find the correct image to do the slideshow.

Reload your "slides.html" and click the button "Play". The slideshow should start. Then press the button "Stop", and the slideshow should stop.




Step 3
-------

Currently, each image in the slideshow plays for 3 seconds. Each image has an aspect ratio of 1:1 (i.e., 600px by 600px). You may use any image size as long as it is 1:1, preferably all images are of the same size. Our slides.html is responsive, i.e., it will resize the images according to the browser window size.

If your slideshow is working (i.e., you have completed step 2), you are going to use 6 images of your own choice (images about your favorite singers/celebrities etc.) instead of 3. You need to modify the show() function to count from 0 to 5.


function show() 
{

   if (current == 0) 
   {
      img.src = "celine.jpg"
      current = 1
   } 
   else if (current == 1) 
   {
      img.src = "adele.jpg"
      current = 2
   } 
   else if (current == 2) 
   {
      img.src = "shania.jpg"
      current = 0
   }

}

We will change the lines img.src to the images that you have collected. For example, 


   if (current == 0) 
   {
      img.src = "image01.jpg"
      current = 1
   } 
   else if (current == 1) 
   {
      img.src = "image02.jpg"
      current = 2
   } 
   else if (current == 2) 
   {
      img.src = "image03.jpg"
      current = 3
   }
   else if (current == 3) 
   {
      img.src = "image04.jpg"
      current = 4
   } 
   else if (current == 4) 
   {
      img.src = "image05.jpg"
      current = 5
   }
   else if (current == 5) 
   {
      img.src = "image06.jpg"
      current = 0
   }

You also need to change the default <img> src in the HTML file, e.g., to the last image in your list of 6 images, i.e., "image06.jpg".


Now reload your slides.html. It should now work with 6 images of your choice.





Step 4
------
The following JavaScript line controls the playing time period of each image:

    slideShowTimer = setInterval( show, 2000 ) 

This states that the slideshow is changing every 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds). Now, change it to

    slideShowTimer = setInterval( show, 1000 ) 

Then, reload your "slides.html" and then click "Play". The slideshow should now be changing faster!

The shorter the time, the faster the slideshow. Try 500, 2500, etc.

If you change the timer value to 2000 (i.e., 2 seconds), then you need to update the CSS animation time as well. That is, from 3s to 2s; otherwise, the animation doesn't match the slideshow speed.

.w3-animate-fading {animation:fading 3s infinite}@keyframes fading{0%{opacity:0}50%{opacity:1}100%{opacity:0}}

.w3-animate-zoom {animation:animatezoom 3s infinite}@keyframes animatezoom{from{transform:scale(0)} to{transform:scale(1)}}



Step 5
------
Now, we will make the <h1> heading changing everytime the image changes.

In "slides.html" file, add an id="myheading" to the <h1> tag. That is,

<h1 id="myheading">Famous Female Singers</h1>

Then, in the show() function, add the following line below each img.src line. For example,

    img.src = "image01.jpg"
    heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 1"

Say something about "image01.jpg".

Do the same for the other lines.

    img.src = "image02.jpg"
    heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 2"

etc. Your show function should now look something like this:


   if (current == 0) 
   {
      img.src = "image01.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 1"
      current = 1
   } 
   else if (current == 1) 
   {
      img.src = "image02.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 2"
      current = 2
   } 
   else if (current == 2) 
   {
      img.src = "image03.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 3"
      current = 3
   }
   else if (current == 3) 
   {
      img.src = "image04.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 4"
      current = 4
   } 
   else if (current == 4) 
   {
      img.src = "image05.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 5"
      current = 5
   }
   else if (current == 5) 
   {
      img.src = "image06.jpg"
      heading.innerHTML = "blah blah blah 6"
      current = 0
   }

Now, reload "slides.html". Click "Play" and see what happens! The heading should change whenever the image changes.




Step 6
-------
Inside the play() function, there exists a line to change the <img> tag class as follows.

function play() 
{
    // create a timer once every 2000 milliseconds for "show()"
    slideShowTimer = setInterval( show, 3000 )
    img.classList.add("w3-animate-zoom")
}

It essentially changes the <img> to class="w3-animate-zoom" dynamically until the play() starts, i.e., the slideshow starts.


We remove the class when the slideshow stops:

function stop()
{
  clearInterval(slideShowTimer)
  img.classList.remove("w3-animate-zoom")
}

You may experiment with w3-animate-fading or w3-animate-zoom class; it affects the whole slideshow when it starts playing.



Step 7
------
You can now modify the stylesheet <style></style> to meet the remaining styling requirements.
